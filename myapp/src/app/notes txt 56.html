im typing them

angular front end notes
om prder tp travel from page to page you use routing

for rouiting to wokr what we have to do is make app.co,ponent.html main template of our solution

app.c.h is main page and will be uniform through all pages shown on all pages in our app (singe pa)

<router-outlet></router-outlet> (example)

nav bar has drop downs and is shown w router after html structure we are prociding in component

when we click on dropdown it hsould show all content in gtmlk file requested

routerLink="/inventory"

app.routes.ts 

export const routes: Routes = [{path: inventory, component:inventroyComponent}]

we need to include app routes and routermodule into app c h

(we can use this for menus)

i said we but its just me idk sounds better
